Photorecover
------------

Version: 0.9.0

Photorecover is a utility to recover Jpeg/Exif/Jfif files from memory card.


INSTALLATION

  $ make

  $ make install


USAGE

  $ photorecover [disk image | device file]

  ie. photorecover /dev/sda1
  or  photorecover foobar.img


Photorecover tries to restore Jpeg/Exif/Jfif files from fat filesystem
image or from device containin the fat filesystem. Recovered
photos are saved to the current working directory.

Filename of the saved photo is damaged_<number>.jpg if the
file is only a fragment of the original and cluster_<number>.jpg
otherwise. <number> is the first cluster used by the photo.

Operation is a little faster if you use the filesystem image.
You can make one with program dd.


TODO

 - At this point photorecover can restore unfragmented files only.
 - Optimization
