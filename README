Photorecover
------------

Version: 0.9.0

Photorecover is a simple utility to recover Jpeg/Exif/Jfif files from
a memory card. Though this is a working software, it still was more or
less for me to experiment recovering photos from FAT -filesystem. For
real uses I recommend PhotoRec: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec


INSTALLATION

  $ make

  $ make install


USAGE

  $ photorecover [disk image | device file]

  e. photorecover /dev/sda1
  or  photorecover foobar.img


Photorecover tries to restore Jpeg/Exif/Jfif files from FAT file system
image or from device containing the fat file system. Recovered
photos are saved to the current working directory.

Filename of the saved photo is damaged_<number>.jpg if the
file is only a fragment of the original and cluster_<number>.jpg
otherwise. <number> is the first cluster used by the photo.

If you use usb card reader the operation is a little faster if you make
the file system image first instead of reading straight from device file.
You can make one with program dd.


TODO

 - At this point photorecover can restore unfragmented files only.
 - Optimization
 - Translate Finnish source comments
